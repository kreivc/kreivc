I think both combination is a very powerful framework. After trying Next.JS, I no longer have to think about Routing, and I also learned the SSR, ISR, and CSR methods on this framework, which I believe are very important to understand. I also like Tailwind CSS because there is no need to move files to edit the style instead, it can be done directly in className. Tailwind CSS is the same as CSS in general, only abbreviated to make it easier to read, but I think inline css in className will make it harder for us to read code / change style.",

This website is very simple, similar to a website medium, where we can see feeds or all blog posts, create posts with single images, update and delete posts, authentication, and user settings. The development of this application goes quite smoothly until, after the deployment, it is discovered that the image that I upload to the backend every 24 hours is reset because I use heroku. The first approach I took was to use base64 encode images and save them to MongoDB. However, this results in new issues such as longer loading times and decreased performance. I then attempted to add skeleton loading to make the loading process more realistic. Less than satisfied with the slow performance, I researched image storage and discovered that images should not be stored directly in the backend or in the database, necessitating the use of a third-party provider. I chose cloudinary and the results are quite satisfactory and until now I still use cloudinary.",
